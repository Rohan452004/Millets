  <h2>Title for Problem Solution</h2>
  <p>Utilizing Technology to Improve Health through Millet Consumption</p>
</section>

  <section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The International Year of Millets 2023 (IYM 2023) celebrates the significance of millets in promoting good health and well-being.
    Millets are highly nutritious grains with essential nutrients, minerals, and dietary fiber. However, their consumption and popularity
    have been relatively low. This problem solution aims to address the need for utilizing technology to enhance the health benefits of
    millets and encourage their incorporation into people's diets.

  <h2>Need for Solution</h2>
  <p>
    The current global health landscape emphasizes the importance of a balanced diet for overall well-being. Millets, with their unique
    nutritional profile, have the potential to contribute significantly to good health. However, limited awareness, accessibility, and
    lack of appealing millet-based products hinder their widespread consumption. It is crucial to address this gap and promote millet
    consumption as a means to improve health outcomes and address nutritional challenges.

      benefits, recipes, and easy online ordering options.</li>
    <li><strong style = "color: #4c8bf5;">Smart Farming Technologies:</strong> Implement precision agriculture techniques, such as IoT sensors, drones, and data analytics,
      to optimize millet cultivation. This can enhance crop yield, quality, and reduce the use of harmful chemicals, resulting in healthier
      and more sustainable millets.</li>
    <li><strong style = "color: #4c8bf5;">Recipe and Meal Planning Apps:</strong> Create mobile applications that offer millet-based recipes, meal plans, and personalized
      nutrition recommendations. These apps can educate users about the health benefits of millets, provide cooking tips, and facilitate meal
      planning incorporating millet-based dishes.</li>
    <li><strong style = "color: #4c8bf5;">Food Processing Innovations:</strong> Encourage research and development in food processing technologies to produce innovative
      millet-based products. This can include techniques for making millet flour, extrusion processes for snacks, and incorporating millets
      into ready-to-eat meals, making them more convenient and appealing to a wider audience.</li>
  </ol>
